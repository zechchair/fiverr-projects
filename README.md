Dear valued clients,

It's important to note that communicating outside of the Fiverr platform is against the rules. Therefore, please Don't make it obvious that we are talking here .


I'm reaching out to inform you that Fiverr charges a 20% fee for my services. However, the minimum cost to undertake your project is $400. To streamline our communication and avoid Fiverr fees, I suggest contacting me through my phone number via WhatsApp or Telegram, as I do with all my clients. This will ensure smoother conversations and eliminate the extra 20% Fiverr fee, saving you approximately $100.

If you prefer to work exclusively through Fiverr, please be aware that the 20% fee will be added to your total, resulting in an additional cost of nearly $100.

In any case, here is my phone number: +33758861661. Otherwise if you don't feel confortable of sharing your phone number. please this is my gmail account and we can talk on google chat : zakaria.echchair@gmail.com

Best regards
